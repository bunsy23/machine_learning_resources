# Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence/Deep Learning

## Purpose

When I started learning Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning, I found myself hard to grasp some ideas related to these fields. Thus, I created this repository as a collection of resources that I used to assist my learning in Machine learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning.

## AI vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

AI is a superset of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
Machine learning is a superset of Deep Learning.

## 📖 Books

### 1. [Hands-On Machine Learning with SciKit-Learn & TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781098125967/)
 
The book covers a wide range of ML, AI, and DL concepts along with actual codes. It is a great book for beginners who are interested in ML, AI, and DL. However, according to my experience, you should start off by following [Coursera Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home) first. You can just watch the videos in the Week 1 only.

## 💻 Online Tutorials

### 1. [Coursera Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home)

This online course provided in Coursera by Standford and DeepLearning.ai is a great place for absolute beginners.
